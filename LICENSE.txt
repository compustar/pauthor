1. Definitions

a. “Original Software” is the software provided by Microsoft in its original form before any derivative works are created, but including any bug fixes or other modifications subsequently supplied by Microsoft.

b. An “Extensible Licensed Product” is a Microsoft product that the Original Software communicates with via an API, file format, schema, network protocol, or other interoperation or extension mechanism.

c. The “Licensed Platform” is the execution environment on which the Original Software functioned, such as a Microsoft Windows operating system, Windows Azure, or Windows Mobile Phone.

d. A “Derived Software Work” is software based on the Original Software or based on another Derived Software Work, and that:
(1.d.1) runs on the Licensed Platform, and
(1.d.2) extends or interoperates with the same Extensible Licensed Products as the Original Software. 


Software modified, hosted, or ported to (1) run on a different platform or (2) extend or interoperate with a product other than the Extensible Licensed Product(s) is not a Derived Software Work.

2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
• You may install and use any number of copies of the Original Software or Derived Software Work on your devices running validly licensed copies of the Extensible Licensed Products.

• The license terms and use rights in this agreement extend only to the Original Software or Derived Software Works. 

• Subject to the terms of this license Microsoft grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the Original Software. Patents licensed under this grant are limited to those patents that cover Microsoft’s code as it appears in the Original Software or Derived Software Works. Microsoft does not grant an express or implied license to patents that cover non-Microsoft code in Derived Software Works.

You agree that Microsoft is not responsible for any problems that result from modifications made or distributed by you or a third party (including any third party acting on your behalf).

• Service and Support for Modified Code. You agree that Microsoft does not, and will not have any obligation to provide service releases, technical or other support for any modifications to the Original Software, Derived Software Work, or programs made by you or any third party (including any third party acting on your behalf) whether they are a Derived Software Work or not.

• others have the right to modify it.

4. TERMINATION. In the event that you sue Microsoft for patent or copyright infringement and assert a claim against the Original Software, a Derived Software Work, an Extensible Licensed Product, or the Licensed Platform, your rights under this agreement, including all copyright and patent licenses from Microsoft, terminate.

5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The Original Software and Derived Software Works are licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the Original Software or Derived Software Works.

8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement.

9. APPLICABLE LAW.

a. United States. If you acquired the Original Software or Derived Software Works in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.

10. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the Original Software or Derived Software Works. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The Original Software or Derived Software Works are licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.
This limitation applies to
• anything related to the Original Software or Derived Software Works, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
• claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
